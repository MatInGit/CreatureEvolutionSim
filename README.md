# CreatureEvolutionSim
A small evolution simulation built using the pygame library.
The goal of the program was to simulate a simple eco-system with slowly regenerating food in order to force the agents to compete and fight for resources and see what trends arise as the result of the environmental pressures. 

To Do:

-Carnivorous/ Aggressive behaviours.

-Mini-neural networks implemented in agents.

-Multi-core/thread operation.

-Some kind of tool tip.

-Rework the co-ordinate system to a grid based one rather than pixel based.

To run the code simply run game.py. Python will generate the agents and food sources. The lines are the agents direction and also indicate the line of sight distance.
